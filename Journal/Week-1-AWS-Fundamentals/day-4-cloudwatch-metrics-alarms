# Day 4: CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- Launched a Free Tier EC2 instance (`cloudwatch-demo-ec2`)
- Enabled CloudWatch default monitoring for EC2
- Created a CloudWatch alarm for CPU utilization > 20%
- Verified metrics started populating after instance uptime
- Explored the CloudWatch console (Metrics, Alarms, Logs preview)
- Terminated the instance after testing to conserve Free Tier usage

## 🔎 Alarm Summary
- Alarm name: `HighCPUUsageAlarm-cloudwatch-demo-ec2`
- Metric: `CPUUtilization`
- Threshold: > 20%
- Evaluation period: 1 x 5-minute window
- Action: No SNS alert configured (yet)

## 💡 What I Learned
- CloudWatch provides built-in EC2 metrics for free
- Some metrics (like `StatusCheckFailed`) may take time to appear
- “Name” is just a tag with the key `Name` — not a unique property
- Tagging, naming, and teardown are critical for real-world ops

## 💭 Advice for Future Interns
> Always terminate your EC2 instances unless you're actively using them. Free Tier is generous — but it's not infinite.
