# Day 6: Intro to AWS Lambda - Hello World Function

## âœ… Tasks Completed
- Created a Lambda function (`hello-world-jon`) using Python
- Used built-in editor to write and deploy basic function
- Executed function manually with test event
- Verified output: `Hello from Lambda, Jon!`

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- Lambda runs code without provisioning or managing servers
- Permissions are still critical â€” execution role determines what the function can do
- The default role allows logs to CloudWatch (observability = built-in)

## ðŸ”­ Next Steps
- Trigger Lambda from S3 upload
- Connect Lambda to other AWS services
- Explore packaging code with dependencies

## ðŸ’­ Advice for Future Interns
> Lambda is incredibly fast and easy to launch â€” but understanding permissions and triggers makes it truly powerful.
