# Deployment Models

## Public Cloud
- AWS by default
- Cloud services provided by third-party providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Lower Cost, shared infrastructure (pay-as-you-go)
- Highly Scalable
- Less Control of Infrastrucure
- Useful for Starups, Web apps, and Dev/Test environments

## Private Cloud
- Infrastrucure used exclusively by one organization
- Expensive
- Used by banks, government (not as much), and regulated industries
- Private cloud with AWS (VMware Cloud on AWS)

# Hybrid
- Requires more complex integration
- Direct connect (private network link between on-prem and cloud)
- Outposes (AWS hardware on-prem)
